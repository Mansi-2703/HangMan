# HangMan
**Hangman Game**: A Python-based Hangman game where the player guesses letters to uncover a hidden word. The game tracks lives, displays a hangman graphic, and provides feedback on repeated guesses and incorrect letters. The code uses external modules for word lists and hangman art, making it modular and easy to customize.
